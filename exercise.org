** Lord of Rings
   My favorite scenes are (in this order)
   1. The attack of the Rohirrim
   2. Eowyn's fight with the witch king.
      - this was already my favorite scene in the book
      - I really like Miranda Otto.
   Important actors in the film are:
   - Elijah Wood :: he plays Frodo
   - Sean Astin  :: He plays Sam, Frodo's friend.
